# Exploratory Data Analysis on Telecom-Users 

Introduction
The Telecom Users data set contains 23 columns and 6050 rows of information. I imported varies libraries such as pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib to assist my analysis and loaded the excel file into Jupyter notebook.

# Objectives

1.	To glean any patterns or relationships from the data 
2.	To make recommendations to stakeholders for future areas of growth and potential savings.

# Data Cleaning

In summary I carried out the following:

•	I identified missing values were present in two columns ‘Provider’ and ‘Age’ I  decided to remove these from my dataset as they were not relevant. 
•	I identified the types of the columns and decided to change the ‘Total Charges’ column from an object to a float to assist with my analysis to follow. 
•	I removed the ‘Unnamed: 0’ column as this was not required.

# Missing Data

In summary I carried out the following:

•	I identified null values and removed the two columns ‘Provider’ and ‘Age’ as their fields could not be determined.
